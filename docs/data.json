These will\nnot change, except for trivial changes such as fixing spelling and\ngrammar, as well as adding improved examples or explanations.\n\nDraft versions will either be named `<yyyy>-<mm>-draft` if there is a\ntarget release date, or simply `draft` for the most bleeding edge (and\nleast stable) version, corresponding to the `master` branch in the\nrepository. These drafts can change in any way at any time.\n\nSelect a version to browse from the left navigation bar.\n\n## References\n\n* Website: <https://ccs-specs.icpc.io>\n* Github: <https://github.com/icpc/ccs-specs>\n\nThe problem package format specification can be found at: <https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/>\n\n## Development notes\n\nThis documentation is build with the script `update_docs.sh` from this\n`gh-pages` branch.

That should update the documentation, which you can\nthen push.\n","dir":"/","name":"readme.md","path":"readme.md","url":"/"}]
