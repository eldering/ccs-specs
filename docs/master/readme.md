# CCS specifications

There are multiple versions of the CCS specifications available below. 

Stable versions will use the naming scheme `<yyyy>-<mm>`. The meaning of these
will *not* change, but trivial changes such as fixing spelling and grammar, as
well as adding improved examples or explanations is allowed.

Draft versions will either be named `<yyyy>-<mm>-draft` if there is a target
release date, or simply `draft` for the most bleeding edge (and least stable)
version. These can change in any way at any time.

* [draft](/draft)
* [2021-11-draft](/2021-11-draft)
* [2020-03](/2020-03) - Latest stable version
