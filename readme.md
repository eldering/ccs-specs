# 2020-03 Contest Control System (CCS) specification

This branch contains the 2020-03 CCS specification for
interoperability between different contest control systems and tools
that interact with them. These specifications have been designed and
used in the context of the [ICPC World Finals](https://icpc.global)
and various (sub)regionals, but they are meant to be useful outside
the ICPC context as well.

The following specifications are present:

* Contest Control System requirements for the ICPC World Finals
* Contest API: an API specification for accessing information
  provided by a CCS.
* Contest Archive Format: a format closely related to the Contest API
  for storing contest information on disk.

This is the `2020-03` release of the CCS specification.
Other versions of the CCS specifications are available
[here](https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/).
